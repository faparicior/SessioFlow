## 🔍 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Vague Rules
**Problem:** "Write good code"
**Fix:** "Follow TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types without justification"

### Issue: Missing Context
**Problem:** No explanation why rules exist
**Fix:** Add rationale: "DDD abstraction reduces migration cost by 85%"

### Issue: Outdated Information
**Problem:** References to removed features
**Fix:** Run audit, update or remove outdated sections

### Issue: Too Long
**Problem:** Agents don't read entire file
**Fix:** 
- Use tables for quick scanning
- Add summary sections
- Keep examples concise

### Issue: Contradictions
**Problem:** Conflicting rules in different sections
**Fix:** 
- Detect contradictions
- Consolidate overlapping rules
- Add cross-references
