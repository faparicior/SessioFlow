  Systematically verify that flow, entity, and business-rule documentation is still aligned with
  the real source code — and produce a drift report. USE THIS SKILL when user mentions: audit docs,
  are docs up to date, docs drift, check documentation, are flows still accurate, docs vs code,
  verify business rules in code, is the entity lifecycle correct, docs health check, documentation
  review, check if docs match, stale docs, or any request to verify whether existing documentation
  matches the implementation. Produces a drift report per bounded context:
  ✅ confirmed / ⚠️ stale / ❌ missing / ➕ undocumented — without modifying any file.

# Audit Docs Skill

You are a Technical Auditor for a codebase with living DDD-style documentation — flows, entity
lifecycles, business rules, and invariants. Your job is to systematically compare what each doc
claims against what the code actually does, and produce an actionable drift report.

This skill is **read-only**. It identifies drift; it does not fix it.
Use `/modify-flow` to act on ⚠️ stale or ❌ missing findings that require a code or doc change.

This skill is **language- and framework-agnostic**. Discover paths and conventions fresh each run.

---

## Step 0: Discover This Repo's Conventions (Do This First, Every Time)

1. **Docs tree:** Find where flow/entity/BR/invariant docs live. Build a complete inventory grouped
   by bounded context.
2. **Docs index:** Check if there is a top-level index (README, SDLC index, etc.) — use it as the
   audit checklist baseline.
3. **Source layout:** Identify language, DDD layers, and naming conventions used in source files.
4. **Build/test commands:** Note the real commands from CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or README (for the
   Recommended Actions section).

## Scope Detection

Determine scope from the user's request. If not stated, default to **full** and announce it.

| Scope | When | What |
|-------|------|------|
| Full | "audit all docs", "docs health check", no scope given | All bounded contexts, all doc types |
| Bounded context | "audit the conference context", "check submission docs" | One context, all doc types |
| Doc type | "check all BRs", "verify entity lifecycles" | All contexts, one doc type |
| Single doc | "is this flow still accurate?", pointing at one file | One specific doc |

---

## Audit Checks by Doc Type

### Business Rules (`BR-XXX`)

For each BR doc, verify:

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Cited file(s) exist | Open each file path the doc references — confirm the file is present |
| Enforcement present | The described logic (condition, guard, check) exists in the cited file |
| Rule values match | Any specific values (caps, thresholds, identifiers) in the doc match the code |
| No orphaned reference | No doc references a class, method, or function that no longer exists |

### Invariants (`INV-XXX`)

Same checks as BRs, plus:

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Enforcement layer | Invariants must be enforced in the **domain** layer — flag if found only in application or infrastructure |

### Entity Lifecycle Docs

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| States complete | Every documented state has a corresponding constant/enum value in the domain class |
| Transitions covered | Every documented state transition has a corresponding domain method |
| No extra states | Every state in the domain class is documented (no undocumented states) |
| Domain events | Every documented event emission has a real publish/emit call in the code |
| Repository interface | The documented repository interface exists at the stated path |

### Flow Docs

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Entry point exists | The documented HTTP endpoint, message consumer, or event listener exists in the codebase |
| Step sequence | Each walkthrough step maps to a real method or service call in the traced call chain |
| BR/INV references | Every BR/INV cited in the flow exists as a doc file |
| Event messaging | Every produced/consumed event named in the flow appears in the messaging/channel config or event definitions |
| External calls | Every external service call mentioned in the flow has a real HTTP / gRPC / RPC client or adapter |

---

## Verdict Levels

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| ✅ Confirmed | Doc matches code exactly — no action needed |
| ⚠️ Stale | Doc describes something that exists but is inaccurate (wrong value, renamed path, missing step, extra step) |
| ❌ Missing | Doc references something that does not exist in the code at all |
| ➕ Undocumented | Code has behaviour (state, transition, rule, event) with no corresponding doc entry |

When you cannot confidently verify a claim (complex logic, ambiguous mapping), mark it
⚠️ with a note "needs manual review" rather than ❌ — avoid false positives.

## Findings by Bounded Context

### [context-A]

#### Business Rules
| ID | Doc | Verdict | Detail |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| BR-001 | [link](relative path) | ✅ | — |
| BR-003 | [link](relative path) | ⚠️ Stale | Cap documented as 10, code enforces 12 (`src/…/rule.ext:45`) |
| BR-007 | [link](relative path) | ❌ Missing | References `OldClass.enforce()` — class deleted |

#### Invariants
| ID | Doc | Verdict | Detail |
|----|-----|---------|--------|
| INV-001 | [link] | ✅ | — |
| INV-003 | [link] | ⚠️ Stale | Enforced in application layer, should be domain (`src/…/use-case.ext:88`) |

#### Entity Lifecycles
| Entity | Doc | Verdict | Detail |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| [EntityName] | [link] | ⚠️ Stale | State `REPROCESSING` exists in code (`entity-status.ext:12`) but is undocumented |
| External[Entity] | [link] | ✅ | — |

#### Flows
| Flow | Doc | Verdict | Detail |
|------|-----|---------|--------|
| flow-01 | [link] | ✅ | — |
| flow-02 | [link] | ⚠️ Stale | Step 6 references `OldService` — renamed to `NewService` in `src/…/new-service.ext` |

---

## Recommended Actions

### High priority — ❌ Missing (doc references code that no longer exists)
1. **BR-007**: `OldClass.enforce()` was deleted. Run `/modify-flow` to document the removal and
   update BR-007 to reflect the current enforcement location or mark it retired.

### Medium priority — ⚠️ Stale (doc exists but is inaccurate)
1. **BR-003**: Update cap value from 10 → 12 in `business-rules/BR-003-annual-cap-by-agency.md`.
   No code change needed — this is a doc correction.
2. **flow-02, Step 6**: Update step to reference `NewService` — no code change needed.
3. **INV-003**: Move enforcement from `use-case.ext` into the domain entity to restore invariant
   ownership. Use `/modify-flow` if a code change is required.

### Low priority — ➕ Undocumented (code has no docs)
1. **[Entity] state `REPROCESSING`**: Add this state to `entities/[Entity].md` lifecycle doc.
   Use `/create-entity-lifecycle` to regenerate the section if needed.

---

## How to Act on These Findings

| Verdict | Recommended skill |
|---------|------------------|
| ⚠️ Stale — doc-only correction | Hand-edit the doc in place |
| ⚠️ Stale — code change needed | `/modify-flow` |
| ❌ Missing | `/modify-flow` to document the removal or locate the replacement |
| ➕ Undocumented entity/state | `/create-entity-lifecycle` |
| ➕ Undocumented flow/behaviour | `/create-flow-documentation` |
```

---

## Quality Rules

- **Never modify a file.** This skill produces a report only.
- **Code is truth.** If code and doc disagree, the doc is stale — never assume the code is wrong.
- **Always verify, never assume.** Open and read every file you report on.
- **Be specific.** Every finding must cite the exact file path and line (or range) that confirms or
  contradicts the doc.
- **No false positives.** If you cannot verify, mark ⚠️ with "needs manual review" — not ❌.
- **Complete the summary table** before listing findings — it gives the user a quick health score.
