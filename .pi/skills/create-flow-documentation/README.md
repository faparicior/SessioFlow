1. **Read the journey** from `docs/inception/6-user-journey-mapping.md` or other journey sources
2. **Extract requirements**: persona, goal, steps, impacted entities, bounded context
3. **Generate complete flow documentation** with:
   - 3 Mermaid diagrams (sequence, flowchart, state)
   - Step-by-step walkthrough table
   - Acceptance criteria (Gherkin format)
   - Edge cases (business, technical, validation)
   - Technical notes (API, Zod, DB constraints, RLS)
   - Business rules and invariants
   - Domain events documentation

4. **Save to correct location**: `docs/product/bounded-contexts/[context]/flows/journey-[XX]-[name].md`
