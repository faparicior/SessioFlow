# User Story Mapping Skill

Facilitate Jeff Patton-style User Story Mapping workshops through 6 structured steps:
**Frame the Problem** -> **Map the Big Picture** -> **Explore to Fill the Body** -> **Slice Release Strategy** -> **Slice Learning Strategy** -> **Slice Development Strategy**.

This skill operates in 3 distinct modes:

1. **`from-inception`** (Bridge Mode): Reads existing `docs/inception/` artifacts and maps them into formal User Story Mapping deliverables in `docs/user-story-mapping/`.
2. **`standalone`**: Facilitates the 6 steps interactively or in batch directly from user requirements without requiring Inception docs.
3. **`validate`**: Runs quality audits on existing USM files using evaluation rubrics to check story depth, INVEST criteria, fake stories, and release slicing.

## Autonomous Decisions & Sensible Defaults

When requirements leave room for interpretation, proceed autonomously using the following precedence:

| Decision Domain | Default Choice | Rationale / Heuristic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Source** | `docs/inception/` if present, else prompt | If Inception docs exist, prioritize them as source of truth. |
| **Scope Authority** | `8-mvp-canvas-definition.md` | Step 8 overrides earlier inception steps if scope contradicts. |
| **Story Slicing** | Vertical slices (thin end-to-end) | Every release slice must cross the backbone and deliver value. |
| **Story Format** | Strict 4-part Story Cards | Title, Narrative, Acceptance Criteria, Design/Technical Notes. |
| **Technical Tasks** | Sub-bullets inside Story Cards | Never create standalone "technical stories" (e.g. "Create DB"). |

---

## Template Usage Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Template instructions and guidance must NEVER appear in output documents.**

Templates provide structure for output documents, while mapping guides provide extraction rules for AI agents. When writing files to `docs/user-story-mapping/`:

- **REMOVE** all "Instructions", "How to use", checklists, and meta-commentary.
- **KEEP** all structural headers, tables, diagrams, and actual story cards.
- Ensure every major MVP story card follows the 4-part format:
  1. **Title**
  2. **Narrative** (`As a... I want... So that...`)
  3. **Acceptance Criteria** (testable conditions)
  4. **Design/Technical Notes** (API, DB, UI constraints, dependencies with `**Dep:**`)

## Natural Language Activation

This skill automatically detects user intent from conversational requests:

| Intent | Natural Language Examples | Mode Activated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Convert Inception** | "Generate user story map from inception", "Convert inception to story map" | `--mode from-inception` |
| **Start Workshop** | "Start a user story mapping workshop", "Let's do story mapping" | `--mode standalone --step 1` |
| **Specific Step** | "Let's map the big picture", "Explore the body of the story map", "Slice release" | `--mode standalone --step [N]` |
| **Batch Generation** | "Generate full user story map for...", "Auto-generate USM documents" | `--mode standalone --batch` |
| **Validate Output** | "Validate story map step 3", "Check if stories meet INVEST", "Audit story map" | `--mode validate --step [N]` |

---

## Command-Line Interface

### Syntax

```bash
pi skill user-story-mapping [--mode <mode>] [--step <1-6>] [--file <path>]
```

### Modes

- `--mode from-inception`: Synthesizes USM artifacts from `docs/inception/` using mapping definitions.
- `--mode standalone`: Facilitates step-by-step or batch generation from prompt context.
- `--mode validate`: Audits an existing step document against its validator rubric.

### Examples

```bash
# Convert existing Lean Inception artifacts to User Story Mapping (Step 1 to 6)
pi skill user-story-mapping --mode from-inception

# Synthesize a specific step from Inception (e.g., Step 2 Backbone)
pi skill user-story-mapping --mode from-inception --step 2

# Start interactive facilitation from Step 1 (Standalone)
pi skill user-story-mapping --mode standalone --step 1

# Generate all 6 steps in batch mode from user context
pi skill user-story-mapping --mode standalone --batch --context "SessioFlow"

# Validate Step 3 (Story cards, INVEST criteria, fake stories)
pi skill user-story-mapping --mode validate --step 3 --file docs/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body.md
```

## Step Execution Details

### Step 1: Frame the Problem

- **Objective:** Establish the strategic framing, personas, problems, desired outcomes, and boundaries.
- **`from-inception` Sources:**
  - `docs/inception/1-product-vision-and-boundaries.md` (Elevator pitch, goals, Is/Is Not)
  - `docs/inception/3-personas/` (Primary & secondary personas, pain points)
  - `docs/inception/8-mvp-canvas-definition.md` (MVP proposal, success metrics, out-of-scope boundaries)
- **Validator:** `references/1-frame-the-problem-validator.md`

### Step 2: Map the Big Picture

- **Objective:** Construct the horizontal narrative flow: User Activities (Backbone) and sequential User Steps (Walking Skeleton).
- **`from-inception` Sources:**
  - `docs/inception/5-user-journeys/*.md` (Extract steps across personas)
  - `docs/inception/7-features-and-sequencing.md` (Feature order)
- **Critical Rule:** Inception journeys often skip Setup/Config and Wrap-up/Analysis. You **must** identify and insert these flanking steps so the user narrative is continuous from start to finish.
- **Validator:** `references/2-map-the-big-picture-validator.md`

### Step 3: Explore to Fill the Body

- **Objective:** Move vertically down each backbone step, exploring variations, alternatives, exceptions (sad paths), and detailed story cards.
- **Story Card Standards:**
  - Every high-priority story must have a full card with Title, Narrative, Acceptance Criteria, and Design/Technical Notes.
  - Mark external dependencies clearly with `**Dep:**`.
  - Ban "fake" stories: technical chores (e.g., "Create database schema") must be placed inside the Design/Technical Notes of the corresponding user story card, not as independent user stories.
- **Validator:** `references/3-explore-to-fill-the-body-validator.md`

### Step 4: Slice out a Release Strategy

- **Objective:** Carve horizontal release slices across the story map.
- **Slices:**
  - **Wave 1 (MVP):** Minimal end-to-end path that provides real user value.
  - **Wave 2:** Enhancements, scale, secondary persona paths.
  - **Wave 3+:** Future iterations.
- **`from-inception` Sources:**
  - `docs/inception/7-features-and-sequencing.md`
  - `docs/inception/8-mvp-canvas-definition.md`
- **Validator:** `references/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy-validator.md`

### Step 5: Slice out a Learning Strategy

- **Objective:** Uncover riskiest assumptions and construct fast validation experiments (spikes, prototypes, landing page tests).
- **Evaluation Categories:**
  - Feasibility (technical, infrastructure cost)
  - Usability (workflows, UX)
  - Value (willingness to adopt)
  - Business viability
- **Validator:** `references/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy-validator.md`

### Step 6: Slice out a Development Strategy

- **Objective:** Organize the delivery game plan for engineering:
  - **Opening Game:** Spikes, infrastructure setup, Walking Skeleton (thin end-to-end tracer bullet).
  - **Mid Game:** Core value loop, feature completion, exception paths.
  - **End Game:** Hardening, performance, operational launch readiness.
- **Team Capacity Check:** Ensure the Opening Game is achievable within the initial sprint.
- **Validator:** `references/6-slice-out-a-development-strategy-validator.md`

## Validation Mode (`--mode validate`)

When run in validation mode, the skill audits target documents and scores them across:

1. **Structural Completeness:** All required sections populated without residual template instructions.
2. **INVEST Compliance:** Stories represent user value, are independent, negotiable, and testable.
3. **Depth of Exploration:** Sad paths, error states, and alternative branches present.
4. **Scope Fidelity:** Strict adherence to boundaries defined in Step 8 (MVP Canvas) or Step 1 (Problem Frame).
