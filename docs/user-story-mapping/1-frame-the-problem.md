# Frame the Problem (The Opportunity Brief)

Objective: Define the Who and the Why to ensure the discovery team is aligned on the overarching mission.

## 1. The Big Idea (Rock Zero)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | What is the big idea? Provide a concise summary.<br>*(Optional format: For [target], who [need], [product] is [category] that [benefit].)* | For **Event Organizers** (Fernando) who need to **start their event journey**, **SessioFlow** is a **Call for Papers (CfP) launch tool** that **enables the setup and collection of session proposals**. Unlike generic form builders, it is a **lightweight, self-hostable alternative focused purely on content**. |
| **Alignment** | How does this investment align with the current business strategy? | It addresses the **"Urgency of Starting"** strategy defined in the MVP Canvas. By enabling instant CfP creation, we acquire users early in their event lifecycle, buying time to build complex features while proposals are being collected. |

## 2. Target Audience (The Actors)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customers** | Which companies or groups would buy or adopt this product? | **Non-profit organizations** and community tech event organizers who need sophisticated tools but have zero budget. |
| **User Roles** | List the different types of people who will interact with the system. | 1. **Organizer** (Admin/Setup)<br>2. **Speaker** (Submitter)<br>3. **Reviewer** (Future)<br>4. **Attendee** (Future) |
| **Primary Actor** | If you could only thrill one specific type of user to ensure success, who would it be? | **Fernando**, the Community Organizer. He feels the pain of "Spreadsheet Juggling" and is the decision-maker for adopting the tool. |

## 3. The Problem Space (Current State)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Problems** | What specific frustrations, "pains", or challenges do users face right now? | 1. **Repetitive Work:** Setting up forms for every event is annoying.<br>2. **Data Fragmentation:** Managing sessions across email, Excel, and forms leads to errors.<br>3. **Complexity:** Existing specialist tools (e.g., Sessionize) are too complex or expensive for small non-profits. |
| **Solutions Today** | How are users currently solving these problems (e.g. manual workarounds or competitors)? | **Manual Workarounds:** Google Forms + Spreadsheets sets (prone to copy-paste errors).<br>**Competitors:** Sessionize (Great but paid/hosted), Pretalx (Good but complex to host). |
| **The Kicker** | What is the ultimate factual consequence of these pains? | Because existing professional tools are inaccessible (cost/complexity), organizers revert to manual methods, finding themselves "spending half their day fighting with data" instead of managing the event. |

## 4. Desired Outcomes (The Future)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Value** | How will the users’ lives be better once this solution "lands" in their world? | Fernando can launch a professional-looking CfP in **minutes**, not hours, and knows all data is validated and centralized from day one. |
| **Success Metrics** | What specific user behaviours can you measure to indicate the product is valuable (e.g. usage frequency)? | 1. **Activation:** 5 Events created within the first month.<br>2. **Volume:** >50 Proposals collected.<br>3. **Efficiency:** Reduce session organization time by **50%** compared to manual tools. |

## 5. Business Motivation & Impact

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Problem** | What specific organisational challenge does building this solve? | We are failing to capture the low-budget/non-profit market because current solutions are either "too dumb" (Forms) or "too heavy" (Enterprise setups). |
| **Business Metrics** | Which KPIs will be affected (e.g. increased revenue, lower operational costs, or market share)? | 1. **Cost:** Maintain **$0/month** infrastructure cost (Critical Constraint).<br>2. **Adoption:** 80% conversion rate for speakers (starts form -> submits). |

## 6. Boundaries, Constraints, & Risks

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anti-Goals** | What are we explicitly **NOT** doing right now? (Out of Scope) | **Deferred to Wave 2:**<br>❌ Reviewing & Scoring Sessions<br>❌ Co-Speaker Management<br>❌ Bulk Status Updates<br>❌ Assigning Schedule Slots<br>❌ Automated Speaker Emails<br>❌ **Payment Processing** (Permanent Anti-Goal) |
| **Risky Assumptions** | What are the biggest things we believe to be true that might actually be wrong? | 1. We assume users will accept a "Setup & Collect" tool without immediate Review features (The "Coming Soon" bet).<br>2. We assume organizers are technical enough to self-host a "Simple" container (even if we make it easy). |
| **Tech Constraints** | Are there specific architectural or feasibility concerns? | Must run on **Free Tier** infrastructure. No complex microservices. Tech stack: Next.js + Supabase (Storage/Auth) + Tailwind. |
| **Budget / Size** | What is the gut estimate of the time or resources we are willing to invest? | **"The Cupcake":** 3 Sprints (6 Weeks) x 2 Developers. |

## 7. The Decision (Go / No-Go)

Does the team and stakeholders have enough shared understanding to proceed to Story Mapping?

| Decision | Criteria | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Go** | Proceed to Map the Story. | [x] |
| **No-Go** | The problem isn't worth solving or the risks are too high. | [ ] |
| **Recycle** | We need more research (Explore) before we can Frame. | [ ] |

**The Vacation Photo Analogy**
Treat this completed template as a "vacation photo". Just as a photo helps someone who was actually there remember the sights, sounds, and deep context of a trip, this document is a tool to help the discovery team recall the shared understanding and rich discussions that occurred during the framing session—context that an outsider would never fully grasp from the words alone.
