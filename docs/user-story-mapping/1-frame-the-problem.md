# Frame the Problem (The Opportunity Brief)

Objective: Define the Who and the Why to ensure the discovery team is aligned on the overarching mission.

## 1. The Big Idea (Rock Zero)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | What is the big idea? Provide a concise summary.<br>*(Optional format: For [target], who [need], [product] is [category] that [benefit].)* | **For** Event Organizers (Fernando) **who** need to manage the Call for Papers efficiently, **SessioFlow** is a session management tool **that** streamlines the submission, review, and selection process. **Unlike** manual spreadsheets or Google Forms, our product is **specialized for tech events, includes co-speaker support by default, and is free to host.** |
| **Alignment** | How does this investment align with the current business strategy? | Aligned with the goal to democratize event organization for non-profits by enabling a $0/month infrastructure costs and reducing manual administrative effort by 50%. |

## 2. Target Audience (The Actors)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customers** | Which companies or groups would buy or adopt this product? | Non-profit organizations and volunteer-led tech communities. |
| **User Roles** | List the different types of people who will interact with the system. | 1. **Fernando** (Organizer/Admin) <br> 2. **Andrea** (Speaker/Submitter) |
| **Primary Actor** | If you could only thrill one specific type of user to ensure success, who would it be? | **Fernando**, the Volunteer Organizer. We must solve his administrative pain first. |

## 3. The Problem Space (Current State)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Problems** | What specific frustrations, "pains", or challenges do users face right now? | 1. Too repetitive work to organize the Call for Papers.<br>2. Manual data entry and inconsistency often lead to errors.<br>3. Difficult for speakers to add co-speakers to proposals. |
| **Solutions Today** | How are users currently solving these problems (e.g. manual workarounds or competitors)? | Manual spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets), Google Forms, or enterprise tools (Sessionize, Pretalx) that are cost-prohibitive for small, non-profit events. |
| **The Kicker** | What is the ultimate factual consequence of these pains? | Current manual processes have reached a breaking point, limiting the community's ability to grow and causing organizer burnout. |

## 4. Desired Outcomes (The Future)

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Value** | How will the users’ lives be better once this solution "lands" in their world? | Fernando will have a centralized, clean list of scored proposals ready for selection without manual data juggling.<br>Andrea will have a smooth submission flow that respects her need for collaboration. |
| **Success Metrics** | What specific user behaviours can you measure to indicate the product is valuable (e.g. usage frequency)? | 1. **Efficiency:** Organizer spends < 3 minutes on average to review/score a session.<br>2. **Engagement:** > 20% of submitted sessions utilize the Co-Speaker feature.<br>3. **Satisfaction:** NPS > 40 from Organizers. |

## 5. Business Motivation & Impact

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Problem** | What specific organisational challenge does building this solve? | Lack of free, simple tools for community events forces organizers to waste time on manual admin instead of strategy. |
| **Business Metrics** | Which KPIs will be affected (e.g. increased revenue, lower operational costs, or market share)? | 1. **Cost:** Enable 80% of users to run on free-tier infrastructure ($0/month).<br>2. **Time:** Reduce session organization time by 50% compared to manual tools. |

## 6. Boundaries, Constraints, & Risks

| Dimension | Guiding Questions | Team Input |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anti-Goals** | What are we explicitly **NOT** doing right now? (Out of Scope) | 1. Payments/Ticketing management.<br>2. Speaker travel/accommodation logistics.<br>3. Public API (for now).<br>4. AI Content Generation.<br>5. Complex scheduling (Wave 2). |
| **Risky Assumptions** | What are the biggest things we believe to be true that might actually be wrong? | 1. That "Google Forms is easier" might stop adoption.<br>2. That GDPR compliance for email collection might be a barrier.<br>3. That organizers can handle scheduling manually if we don't build it in V1. |
| **Tech Constraints** | Are there specific architectural or feasibility concerns? | 1. **Cost:** Must run on free tiers (Vercel/Supabase).<br>2. **Simplicity:** No complex microservices; keep it monolithic/modular.<br>3. **Security:** Zero-trust for user data; rigorous auth required. |
| **Budget / Size** | What is the gut estimate of the time or resources we are willing to invest? | Estimated 4 Sprints (8 Weeks) for 2 Developers. |

## 7. The Decision (Go / No-Go)

Does the team and stakeholders have enough shared understanding to proceed to Story Mapping?

| Decision | Criteria | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Go** | Proceed to Map the Story. | [ ] |
| **No-Go** | The problem isn't worth solving or the risks are too high. | [ ] |
| **Recycle** | We need more research (Explore) before we can Frame. | [ ] |

**The Vacation Photo Analogy**
Treat this completed template as a "vacation photo". Just as a photo helps someone who was actually there remember the sights, sounds, and deep context of a trip, this document is a tool to help the discovery team recall the shared understanding and rich discussions that occurred during the framing session—context that an outsider would never fully grasp from the words alone.
