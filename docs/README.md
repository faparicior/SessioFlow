# 💡 Lean Inception vs. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Lean Inception and the PRD are two of the most critical artifacts in the product definition phase, but they serve fundamentally different purposes. They are **complementary**, not substitutes.

> **Summary:** Lean Inception is the **collaborative workshop** used to align the team and *define* the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. The PRD is the **formal documentation** that *specifies* the agreed-upon requirements for that MVP.

## 1. Core Differences

The table below highlights the primary distinctions between the process (Lean Inception) and the output (PRD).

| Feature | Lean Inception | Product Requirements Document (PRD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | **Workshop/Process** | **Formal Document/Specification** |
| **Goal** | Achieve **Team Alignment** and **MVP Definition** (The "What" is the MVP?). | Provide **Detailed Instructions** to the development team (The "How" of the MVP). |
| **Timing** | **Discovery Phase** (Before the project officially starts). | **Definition Phase** (After alignment, before Sprints begin). |
| **Key Output** | **MVP Canvas**, **Sequencer** (release plan), **Product Vision**. | **User Stories**, **Functional Requirements**, **Error Handling**, **Non-Functional Requirements**. |
| **Format** | Whiteboards, Post-it Notes, Group Discussion, Sketches. | Structured Text (Markdown/Confluence), Tables, Links to Mocks. |
| **Owner** | The entire **Cross-Functional Team** (PM, Tech Lead, UX, Business). | Primarily owned and maintained by the **Product Manager (PM)**. |

## 2. The Workflow Relationship

Lean Inception provides the strategic direction and constraints, which the Product Manager then translates into the detailed requirements of the PRD.

1.  **Start:** Define the **Product Vision** (The North Star).
2.  **Inception:** The cross-functional team runs the workshop to define the **MVP Canvas** and **Feature Sequencer**. *This solidifies the scope.*
3.  **PRD Creation:** The PM takes the agreed-upon outputs (Personas, Sequencer, MVP Goals) and writes the formal **PRD**.
4.  **Development:** The PRD is handed to the Engineering and Design teams for execution.

## 3. Artifact Mapping

The content generated during the Lean Inception workshop directly forms the high-level sections of the PRD.

| Lean Inception Output | PRD Section it Feeds | Value Provided to the PRD |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Vision** | Executive Summary | The foundational **"Why"** and competitive differentiator. |
| **Personas & Journeys** | User Stories (Who & How) | Validation that features serve real user needs. |
| **Is / Is Not / Does / Does Not** | Scope and Boundaries | Crucial constraints that prevent **Scope Creep**. |
| **MVP Canvas & Metrics** | Goals & Success Metrics | The measurable targets for judging the product's success. |
| **Feature Sequencer** | Functional Requirements | The **Prioritized List** of features for the first release ("Wave 1"). |
