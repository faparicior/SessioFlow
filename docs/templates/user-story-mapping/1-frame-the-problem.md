| **Tech Constraints** | Are there specific architectural or feasibility concerns? |  |
| **Budget / Size** | What is the gut estimate of the time or resources we are willing to invest? |  |

## 7. The Decision (Go / No-Go)

Does the team and stakeholders have enough shared understanding to proceed to Story Mapping?

**The Vacation Photo Analogy**
Treat this completed template as a "vacation photo". Just as a photo helps someone who was actually there remember the sights, sounds, and deep context of a trip, this document is a tool to help the discovery team recall the shared understanding and rich discussions that occurred during the framing session—context that an outsider would never fully grasp from the words alone.
