# Map the Big Picture (The Backbone)

Objective: Create the "spine" of your story map by arranging high-level user activities and tasks in a narrative flow (left-to-right). Focus on the breadth of the story, not the depth


## 1 - The Narrative Context

Who is taking this journey and what is the trigger?

- Primary User Persona: [e.g., The Band Manager]
- Trigger Event: [e.g., The band has a new gig to promote]
- Ultimate Goal: [e.g., The show is sold out and fans are happy]

## 2 - The Backbone (Activities & Tasks)

    Identify the major "User Activities" (high-level goals) and the sequential "User Tasks" (steps to achieve the goal) that form the narrative flow.

**Tip:** Use short verb phrases (e.g., "Search for items," "Check out").

| Sequence | User Activity <br>*(The Big Things)*<br>Aggregates tasks directed at a common goal | User Tasks <br>*(The Steps)*<br>The sequential actions users take to complete the activity | User Role <br>Who performs this? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | [Activity Name]<br>(e.g., Account Setup) | 1. [Task Name]<br>2. [Task Name]<br>3. [Task Name] | [Role] |
| 2 | [Activity Name]<br>(e.g., Finding Product) | 1. [Task Name]<br>2. [Task Name]<br>3. [Task Name] | [Role] |
| 3 | [Activity Name]<br>(e.g., Purchasing) | 1. [Task Name]<br>2. [Task Name]<br>3. [Task Name] | [Role] |
| 4 | [Activity Name]<br>(e.g., Post-Purchase) | 1. [Task Name]<br>2. [Task Name]<br>3. [Task Name] | [Role] |

## 3 - The "And Then..." Check

Read the backbone aloud. Does it tell a coherent story? Use the conjunction "and then..." between steps to test the flow.

- Narrative Check: First the user [Task 1], and then they [Task 2], and then they [Task 3]...
- Missing Links: Are there any gaps in the timeline between activities?
- Notes: [List identified gaps here]

## 4 - Multi-User/System Intersections

Does the narrative require hand-offs between different users or systems?

- Hand-off Points: [e.g., User submits request -> Admin approves request]
- System Actions: [e.g., System sends confirmation email]

🔍 Quality Checklist for Step 2
Use this checklist to validate your Backbone.

- [ ] Chronological Order: Is the map arranged left-to-right in time order?
- [ ] Breadth over Depth: Have we covered the entire story from start to finish before adding details?
- [ ] Verb Phrases: Are the items written as short verb phrases (e.g., "Select movie")?
- [ ] Activities vs. Tasks: Have we grouped tasks under higher-level "Activities" (the diamond-shaped sticky notes)?
- [ ] No Features Yet: Have we focused on what people do (tasks) rather than features the software has?
