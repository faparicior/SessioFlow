# Slice Out a Learning Strategy - Inception Data Sources

This document provides a reference mapping to help fill out the `5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy.md` template using the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop.

## ⚠️ Strategy Note

This step bridges the gap between the **Release Strategy** (What we want to build) and the **Development Strategy** (How we build it) by asking: *Are we sure we're right?*

**Key Heuristic:** High "Risky Assumptions" count = Hard Requirement for Learning Spikes.

| Template Section | Inception Source Document | Sections to Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Riskiest Assumptions** | `docs/inception/8-mvp-canvas-definition.md` (PRIMARY)<br>`docs/inception/1-product-vision-and-boundaries.md` | **Risky Assumptions** (In Vision/Canvas)<br>**Hypothesis:** (The core bet we are making)<br>**Is Not / Does Not:** (Constraints that might anger users) |
| **2. The Learning Slice (MVPe)** | `docs/inception/7-features-and-sequencing.md` | **Effort/Comfort:** Features with low Tech Comfort or high complexity often need simple experiments (paper prototypes) before coding. |
| **3. The "Go/No-Go" Gate** | `docs/inception/8-mvp-canvas-definition.md` | **Failure Condition:** Use the failure criteria defined in the MVP Canvas to set the threshold for "No-Go". |
