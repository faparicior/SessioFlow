# Slice Out a Release Strategy - Inception Data Sources

This document provides a reference mapping to help fill out the `4-slice-out-a-release-strategy.md` template using the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop.

## ⚠️ Precedence Rules

**Step 8 (MVP Canvas) is the PRIMARY SOURCE for the First Release (Slice 1).**
The "Minimum Viable Solution" in User Story Mapping should align directly with the "MVP" defined in Lean Inception.
