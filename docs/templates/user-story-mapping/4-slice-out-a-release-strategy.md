# Slice Out a Release Strategy

Objective: Prioritize outcomes over output. Slice the map horizontally to define the Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)—the smallest amount of output required to achieve the desired outcome for a specific target audience.

## 1. Define the Release Goal (The Outcome)

Before selecting stories, define the success criteria for this specific slice. Don't prioritize features; prioritize the result.

- **Release Name:** [e.g., "The Pilot," "The MVP," or "The Executive Dashboard Update"]
- **Target Audience:** [Who are we satisfying with this specific release?]
- **Desired Outcome:** [What human behavior will change? e.g., "Users can complete a purchase without calling support."]
- **Impact Metric:**
  - **Activation:** [e.g., "5 Events created"]
  - **Volume:** [e.g., ">50 Proposals collected"]
  - **Conversion:** [e.g., "80% completion rate"]

## 2. The Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)

Identify the stories that fall **Above the Line**. These are the stories that are strictly necessary to achieve the outcome defined above. If you remove one, the user cannot achieve the goal.

| Backbone Activity | Selected Stories (Must-Haves) | Why is this in the slice? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Activity Name] | • [Story A]<br>• [Story B] | [e.g., Critical for legal compliance] |
| [Activity Name] | • [Story C] | [e.g., Necessary for user to finish flow] |
| [Activity Name] | • [Story D] | [e.g., Differentiator for this release] |

> **Note:** The "Minimum Viable Solution" is the intersection of what is **Valuable** (users want it), **Usable** (users can figure it out), and **Feasible** (we can build it with current time/tech).

## 3. Subsequent Slices (The Roadmap)

Move the remaining stories into future slices. This forms your release roadmap based on value, not just a schedule.

### Slice 2: [e.g., "The Better/Enhanced Version"]

- **Goal:** [e.g., "Improve retention by adding social features"]
- **Key Stories:**
  - [Story Name]
  - [Story Name]

### Slice 3: [e.g., "The Best/Full Scale Version"]

- **Goal:** [e.g., "Scale to enterprise users"]
- **Key Stories:**
  - [Story Name]
  - [Story Name]

## 4. The Trash / "Not Now" Pile

Explicitly list the ideas that were "good" but didn't make the cut for the foreseeable future. This prevents scope creep.

- **Discarded/Deferred:**
  - [Story Name] - **Reason:** High effort, low value.
  - [Story Name] - **Reason:** Solves a problem users don't care about yet.

🔍 Quality Checklist for Step 4

Use this checklist to validate your release slice.

- [ ] **Cohesion:** If you look only at the stories in Slice 1, can the user complete a full, meaningful journey from start to finish?
- [ ] **Thinness:** Is the slice as thin as possible? Did we remove "nice-to-haves" that don't directly support the target outcome?
- [ ] **Outcome Focus:** Did we prioritize based on what the business/user gets (outcome), not just what the developers build (output)?
- [ ] **Feasibility:** Do we believe this slice is actually buildable in the timeframe we have?
