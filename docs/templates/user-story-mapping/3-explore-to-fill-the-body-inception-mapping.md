# Explore (Filling the Body) - Inception Data Sources

This document provides a reference mapping to help fill out the `3-explore-to-fill-the-body.md` template using the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop.

## ⚠️ Precedence Rules
**Step 8 (MVP Canvas) is the PRIMARY SOURCE for Scope Assignment.**
When assigning "Wave (MVP/2/3)" to a story:
1.  Check `docs/inception/8-mvp-canvas-definition.md` first. If it's in "Critical Path", it is MVP. If "Out of Scope", it is Wave 2+.
2.  Then check `docs/inception/7-features-and-sequencing.md` for items not explicitly mentioned in the Canvas.
