# 1. Product Vision & Boundaries

## 1.1 The Elevator Pitch
*The ultimate direction and differentiation.*

| For | Who | The Product | Is a | That | Unlike | Our Product |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Target Customer] | [Need/Pain Point] | [Product Name] | [Product Category] | [Key Benefit] | [Competitor/Alternative] | [Key Differentiator] |

## 1.2 Product Goals (What we want to achieve)
*High-level business outcomes the product aims for.*

1.  **Goal 1:** [e.g., Increase market share by 10% in 12 months]
2.  **Goal 2:** [e.g., Validate core business model assumption A]
3.  **Goal 3:** [e.g., Achieve 95% user satisfaction score]

## 1.3 The Product Is/Is Not, Does/Does Not
*Defining explicit constraints to manage expectations and scope.*

**Instructions:**
- Provide **at least 4 items** for each column (IS, IS NOT, DOES, DOES NOT)
- Items don't need to be paired - an "IS" doesn't require a corresponding "IS NOT" on the same row
- Focus on clarity: what boundaries will prevent scope creep?

| The Product **IS** | The Product **IS NOT** |
| :--- | :--- |
| [e.g., A mobile-first experience] | [e.g., A desktop application] |
| [e.g., Single-language only] | [e.g., A customer service portal] |
| [e.g., Open source] | [e.g., An enterprise-only solution] |
| [e.g., Lightweight and efficient] | [e.g., Requiring specialized infrastructure] |

| The Product **DOES** | The Product **DOES NOT** |
| :--- | :--- |
| [e.g., Integrate with API X] | [e.g., Require user authentication for MVP] |
| [e.g., Store user preferences] | [e.g., Process payments (only link out)] |
| [e.g., Export data to CSV] | [e.g., Provide real-time collaboration] |
| [e.g., Support email notifications] | [e.g., Manage user billing] |
