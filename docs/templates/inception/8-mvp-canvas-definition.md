# Step 8: MVP Canvas Definition

## Goal
Synthesize all decisions from Steps 1-7 into a final, high-level business plan for the MVP. This canvas should reflect your product vision, constraints, user needs, key features, and sequencing decisions.

---

## Instructions
Review the outputs from previous steps before completing this canvas:
- **Step 1:** Product Vision & Boundaries
- **Step 2:** Tradeoffs & Constraints
- **Step 3:** Personas
- **Step 4:** Empathy Map
- **Step 5:** Features Brainstorming
- **Step 6:** User Journey Mapping
- **Step 7:** Features & Sequencing (Wave 1 = MVP)

---

## 1. MVP Definition
*A succinct statement of the first product increment - the "cupcake" (complete, simple slice of value), not a "layer of cake" (incomplete technical foundation).*

**MVP Proposal:**
[What is the minimum product we are building? Focus on the core value delivery.]

*Example: "A mobile app that allows [Primary Persona] to [core action] in order to [achieve goal], delivering value through [key differentiation]."*

---

## 2. Business Results & Metrics
*What the business hopes to achieve, and how we will measure success.*

### Business Goals
*From Step 1 (Vision) and Step 2 (Tradeoffs) - what are we trying to accomplish?*
1. [e.g., Validate that users will pay for this solution]
2. [e.g., Reduce customer support tickets by 15%]
3. [e.g., Achieve product-market fit in [target segment]]

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
*Quantifiable metrics that directly measure progress toward business goals.*

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| [e.g., Conversion Rate] | [e.g., > 5%] | [e.g., Sign-ups / Visitors] |
| [e.g., Daily Active Users] | [e.g., > 1,000] | [e.g., Analytics dashboard] |
| [e.g., User Satisfaction] | [e.g., NPS > 40] | [e.g., Post-interaction survey] |
| [e.g., Key Task Completion] | [e.g., > 80%] | [e.g., Journey stage analytics] |

### Validation Criteria
*How will we know the MVP succeeded or failed?*
- **Success:** [e.g., At least 60% of test users complete the core journey and rate it 4+ stars]
- **Failure:** [e.g., Less than 30% engagement after first week, indicating poor product-market fit]

---

## 3. MVP Scope - Wave 1 Features
*From Step 7 (Features & Sequencing) - which features are included in Wave 1 (the MVP)?*

### Critical Path Features
*Features required for the minimum happy path identified in Step 6 (User Journey Mapping):*
1. ✅ **[Feature Name]** - [Brief description and why it's critical]
2. ✅ **[Feature Name]** - [Brief description and why it's critical]
3. ✅ **[Feature Name]** - [Brief description and why it's critical]

### Supporting Features (If absolutely necessary)
*Additional Wave 1 features that are essential but not on the critical path:*
- [ ] **[Feature Name]** - [Brief description]

### Explicitly Out of Scope (Wave 2+)
*Important to state what we are NOT building in the MVP:*
- ❌ [Feature/Capability] - *Reason: [e.g., Nice-to-have, not tied to core journey]*
- ❌ [Feature/Capability] - *Reason: [e.g., Requires infrastructure not ready yet]*

---

## 4. Cost, Schedule, and Risks

### Cost Estimate
*Resources required to build and launch the MVP:*
- **Development Effort:** [e.g., 80 person-days, 2 developers x 8 weeks]
- **Infrastructure/Hosting:** [e.g., $5,000 for cloud services]
- **Design/Research:** [e.g., 20 person-days for UX/UI]
- **Other Costs:** [e.g., Third-party API fees, testing tools]

**Total Estimated Cost:** [e.g., $75,000 or equivalent effort]

### Schedule
*Timeline for MVP development and launch:*
- **Duration:** [e.g., 4 Sprints (8 weeks)]
- **Key Milestones:**
  - Week 2: [e.g., Core feature prototype ready]
  - Week 4: [e.g., Alpha testing with internal team]
  - Week 6: [e.g., Beta testing with 20 target users]
  - Week 8: [e.g., MVP launch]

### Risks & Mitigation
*From Step 2 (Tradeoffs) and technical assessment - what could go wrong?*

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| [e.g., Legacy system integration fails] | High | Medium | [e.g., Build abstraction layer early, have fallback] |
| [e.g., Users don't adopt single feature] | High | Low | [e.g., Validate with user testing in Week 6] |
| [e.g., Third-party API unavailable] | Medium | Low | [e.g., Identify backup provider, test early] |

---

## 5. Technical & UX Enablers
*Necessary foundations (not user-facing features) required for the MVP to function. These are the infrastructure and design systems needed.*

### Technical Enablers
- [ ] [e.g., Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment]
- [ ] [e.g., Implement authentication service API]
- [ ] [e.g., Configure database and data models]
- [ ] [e.g., Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure]

### UX Enablers
- [ ] [e.g., Create design system with core UI components]
- [ ] [e.g., Define information architecture for main screens]
- [ ] [e.g., Establish accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)]
- [ ] [e.g., Design error states and loading indicators]

---

## 6. Personas & Journey Alignment
*From Steps 3, 4, and 6 - confirm the MVP serves the primary persona's journey.*

**Primary Persona:** [Name from Step 3]

**Core Journey Supported:**
[Briefly describe the critical path from Step 6 that the MVP enables]

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- [Pain point 1 from Steps 3/4 that MVP solves]
- [Pain point 2 from Steps 3/4 that MVP solves]

**Gains Delivered:**
- [Gain 1 from Step 4 that MVP provides]
- [Gain 2 from Step 4 that MVP provides]

---

## 7. Final Validation Checklist

Before finalizing the MVP Canvas, verify:

- [ ] **Vision Alignment:** Does this MVP deliver on the product vision from Step 1?
- [ ] **Constraints Respected:** Does this respect the tradeoffs and constraints from Step 2?
- [ ] **User-Centered:** Does this solve real problems for the Primary Persona (Steps 3-4)?
- [ ] **Journey Complete:** Can users complete the critical path with Wave 1 features (Step 6)?
- [ ] **Properly Scoped:** Are we building a "cupcake" (complete value) not a "layer" (infrastructure only)?
- [ ] **Measurable:** Can we clearly measure success/failure with the defined metrics?
- [ ] **Achievable:** Is the schedule and cost realistic given the scope?
- [ ] **Risky:** Have we identified and mitigated the biggest risks?

## Next Steps After MVP Definition

Once the MVP Canvas is complete and validated:
1. **Break down features** into user stories and technical tasks
2. **Create sprint plan** based on the schedule
3. **Assign resources** and begin development
4. **Set up measurement** infrastructure for KPIs
5. **Plan user testing** sessions for validation

**Congratulations! You've completed the Lean Inception workshop.** 🎉
