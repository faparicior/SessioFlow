# Step 6: User Journey Mapping

## Goal
Map the brainstormed features to specific stages of the user journey, visualizing how features support the user's path from awareness to achieving their goal. This helps identify feature coverage, gaps, and dependencies.

## Instructions
1. Review the personas defined in Step 3
2. Review the features brainstormed in Step 5
3. Map each feature to one or more stages of the user journey
4. Identify which features are critical at each stage
5. Note any gaps or missing features needed to complete the journey

## Primary Persona Journey

**Persona:** [Name from Step 3]

**Main Goal:** [What is the user trying to achieve?]

## Critical Path Analysis

**The Minimum Happy Path** (features absolutely required for basic user success):
1. [Feature] - at Stage [X]
2. [Feature] - at Stage [X]
3. [Feature] - at Stage [X]
4. [Feature] - at Stage [X]

**Enhanced Path** (features that significantly improve the experience):
- [Feature] - at Stage [X]
- [Feature] - at Stage [X]

## Feature Coverage Matrix

| Feature Name | Journey Stages Covered | Criticality | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| [Feature A] | Stage 1, 2 | Critical | Required for onboarding |
| [Feature B] | Stage 1 | Important | Improves first impression |
| [Feature C] | Stage 2, 3 | Critical | Core value delivery |
| [Feature D] | Stage 4 | Nice-to-have | Retention feature |

## Insights & Observations

**Journey Completeness:**
- [ ] Every journey stage has at least one supporting feature
- [ ] The critical path is fully covered with features
- [ ] No major gaps in the user experience

**Feature Alignment:**
- [ ] All brainstormed features map to at least one journey stage
- [ ] Features that don't map to the journey have been noted for review
- [ ] Feature dependencies are identified

**Key Insights:**
- [Observation about feature distribution across the journey]
- [Observation about any journey stages that are feature-heavy or light]
- [Observation about any critical gaps discovered]

**Next Step:** With the journey map complete, we'll now sequence these features into waves to define the MVP in the next step.
