# ⚖️ Trade-off Board (Project Constraints)

The **Trade-off Board**, often referred to as **"Understanding the Trade-offs"** or **"Sliders"**, is a strategic activity in the execution phase of a Lean Inception. Its purpose is to build a common understanding regarding the "solution of compromise"—an agreement where certain product aspects are deprioritised to favour others that are deemed more vital.

According to the sources, this activity is essential because products are often built on conflicting premises, such as **Security vs Usability** or **Performance vs Flexibility**. By forcing a collaborative conversation, the team reaches a consensus that prevents future misunderstandings and accelerates decision-making.

### Trade-off Board (Sliders) Template

Below is a markdown template based on the "Sliders" format described in the sources.

# Trade-off Board: [Product Name]

**Instructions:**
1.  **Identify Categories:** List all relevant product qualities (e.g., Security, Usability, Cost).
2.  **Rank Importance:** Columns are numbered **1 to N**, where **1 is the most important**.
3.  **The Golden Rule:** Each column can only contain **one** consensus mark. You cannot have two categories at the same priority level.

| Priority Rank | 1 (Most) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 (Least) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Usability** | | | | | | | |
| **Security** | | | | | | | |
| **Performance** | | | | | | | |
| **Flexibility** | | | | | | | |
| **Scalability** | | | | | | | |
| **Cost** | | | | | | | |
| **Simplicity** | | | | | | | |
| **Other** | | | | | | | |

### How to use this template:
*   **Individual Voting:** Participants place their initials (e.g., "PC", "JB") in the cells to indicate their personal perspective of priority.
*   **Consensus:** After discussion, a **different colour** (such as a red post-it) is used to mark the final agreed-upon position for each category.
*   **Constraint:** Ensure that in the final consensus row, every vertical column has exactly one mark.

### Strategic Insight
The source emphasises that this activity is not just about a final list but about the **"open and collaborative conversation"** it triggers. If the team discovers that their individual votes are widely scattered (e.g., some see Security as a '1' and others as a '7'), the facilitator must guide them to resolve these conflicting visions before the MVP construction begins.

**Analogy**
Think of the Trade-off Board as a **limited budget for a holiday**. You might want a five-star hotel, a first-class flight, and a three-week duration, but your budget (the product scope) won't allow all three at the top level. You must "slide" the hotel quality down to a '3' if you insist on keeping the flight at a '1'. You are deciding what the "must-haves" are and what can be sacrificed to stay "Lean".
