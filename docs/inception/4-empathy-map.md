| - *[Fear:]* I will lose opportunities to engage speakers and volunteers if I don't have a tool to help me | - Exporting data from Tool A to CSV, opening Excel, and manually filtering columns and get statistics. |
| - *[Fear:]* - I fear looking not compromised if I don't have the data to show the final selection at the deadline date | -  |
