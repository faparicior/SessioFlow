# Step 5: Features Brainstorming

## Goal
Brainstorm and identify potential features for the product based on the personas and empathy maps defined in previous steps. This is a divergent thinking exercise where quantity is encouraged before filtering.

## Instructions
1. Review the personas and empathy maps from previous steps
2. Brainstorm feature ideas that address user needs, pain points, and goals
3. Think broadly - include both essential and nice-to-have features
4. Organize features into logical categories
5. For each feature, provide a brief description of what it does and why it matters

## Feature Categories

### Core Features
*Features that are essential to the product's primary value proposition*

**Feature 1: [Feature Name]**
- **Description:** [What does this feature do?]
- **Why it matters:** [How does this address user needs or pain points?]
- **Related to:** [Which persona need does this support?]

**Feature 2: [Feature Name]**
- **Description:** [What does this feature do?]
- **Why it matters:** [How does this address user needs or pain points?]
- **Related to:** [Which persona need does this support?]

### Supporting Features
*Features that enhance the user experience but are not critical to the core value*

**Feature 1: [Feature Name]**
- **Description:** [What does this feature do?]
- **Why it matters:** [How does this address user needs or pain points?]
- **Related to:** [Which persona need does this support?]

### Differentiating Features
*Features that set the product apart from competitors*

**Feature 1: [Feature Name]**
- **Description:** [What does this feature do?]
- **Why it matters:** [How does this address user needs or pain points?]
- **Related to:** [Which persona need does this support?]

### Nice-to-Have Features
*Features that could add value but are lower priority*

**Feature 1: [Feature Name]**
- **Description:** [What does this feature do?]
- **Why it matters:** [How does this address user needs or pain points?]
- **Related to:** [Which persona need does this support?]

## Initial Feature Assessment

For each brainstormed feature, provide a quick assessment:

| Feature Name | Business Value | Technical Effort | UX Impact | Priority |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| [Feature name] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | Must-have/Should-have/Nice-to-have |
| | | | | |

## Notes & Observations
*Capture any patterns, concerns, or insights that emerged during brainstorming*

**Next Step:** After completing this brainstorming, we'll map these features to user journeys in the next step.
