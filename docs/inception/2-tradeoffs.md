# ⚖️ Trade-off Board (Project Constraints)

## 1. Trade-off Rule
**The core decision is defining which axis is FIXED.** You must choose **one** (or at most two) critical axis(es) and make the remaining axis(es) flexible.

## 2. The Prioritization Matrix

| **Priority Axis** | **FIXED (Immovable Constraint)** | **FLEXIBLE (Can Adjust/Negotiate)** | **FREE (Least Critical Driver)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SCOPE (Features)** | [Mark 'X' here if the defined feature set MUST be delivered.] | [Mark 'X' here if features can be cut, swapped, or added.] | [Mark 'X' here if feature volume is the easiest thing to compromise on.] |
| **SCHEDULE (Time/Deadline)** | [Mark 'X' here if the delivery date MUST NOT change (e.g., regulatory deadline).] | [Mark 'X' here if the deadline can shift by a few weeks.] | [Mark 'X' here if time pressure is not the primary driver.] |
| **BUDGET (Cost)** | [Mark 'X' here if the total allocated cost MUST NOT be exceeded.] | [Mark 'X' here if the budget can be slightly negotiated up or down.] | [Mark 'X' here if cost is not the primary restriction.] |

## 3. Final Decision Summary
* **The FIXED Axis is:** [Insert the chosen fixed axis, e.g., SCHEDULE]
* **Meaning:** [Insert concise explanation, e.g., "We must ship on time, which means we will sacrifice features (Scope) if necessary."]
* **Agreed By:** [List key stakeholders who agreed to this trade-off.]

> **The primary risk to this project will be related to:** [e.g., Scope, due to the fixed schedule.]
