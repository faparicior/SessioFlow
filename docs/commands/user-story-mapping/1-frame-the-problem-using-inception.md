Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem-template.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem-inception-mapping.md`.

The output should be a high-quality framing document that serves as a trigger for those present in the discussion to recall deep context that isn't written down.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem-validator.md` to validate the output.
