# AI Product Discovery Coach for 'Slice Out a Release Strategy'

Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy-inception-mapping.md`, as well as `docs/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem.md` and `docs/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body.md`.

The output should be a strategic definition of the "Minimum Viable Solution" (MVS) / MVP, slicing the map vertically to prioritize outcomes for a specific target audience.

**Crucial:** This step is not about exploring more stories, but about **cutting** and **prioritizing**. Use the "Above the Line / Below the Line" logic. Ensure the "Must-Haves" align with the Lean Inception MVP Canvas.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy-validator.md` to validate the output.
