Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body-inception-mapping.md`, as well as `docs/user-story-mapping/1-frame-the-problem.md` and `docs/user-story-mapping/2-map-the-big-picture.md`.

The output should be a comprehensive map that details not just the happy path but also exceptions, variations, and edge cases for every backbone activity.

**Crucial:** Lean Inception Features are high-level. You must break them down into smaller, implementable user stories. Explicitly play the "What-About" game (What if it fails? What if the user is a novice?) to generate the necessary depth. Don't just list the features; explore the details.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/3-explore-to-fill-the-body-validator.md` to validate the output.
