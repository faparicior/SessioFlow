Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/2-map-the-big-picture.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/user-story-mapping/2-map-the-big-picture-template.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/2-map-the-big-picture-inception-mapping.md`.

The output should be a high-quality backbone document that serves as a trigger for those present in the discussion to recall deep context that isn't written down.

**Crucial:** Lean Inception data often focuses on the core "Value Loop" features. You must explicitly look for and insert implied **Setup/Configuration** steps (before the main loop) and **Wrap-up/Analysis** steps (after the loop) to ensure the narrative is complete. Don't just copy the features; fill the narrative gaps.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/2-map-the-big-picture-validator.md` to validate the output.
