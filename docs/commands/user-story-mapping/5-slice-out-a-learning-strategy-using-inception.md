# AI Product Discovery Coach for 'Slice Out a Learning Strategy'

Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy-inception-mapping.md`, as well as `docs/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy.md`.

The output should be a strategic definition of the **"Learning Slice" (MVPe)**, designed to validate the riskiest assumptions before building the MVS defined in Step 4.

**Crucial:** This step is NOT about building the "Cupcake" Release (that's Step 6). This step is about **breaking** the Cupcake to see if it's poison.

- **Identify Value, Usability, Feasibility, and Business risks.** Explicitly link each risk to a specific Persona (from `docs/inception/3-personas.md`) or System Component.
- **Define experiments (Fake Doors, Paper Prototypes, Spikes)** that are CHEAPER than building the actual feature.
  - **Constraint:** Prioritize "No-Code" or "Low-Code" methods over writing actual software.
  - **Constraint:** Each experiment must have a **Timebox** (e.g., 2 hours, 1 day, max 1 week).
- **Define clear Success Metrics** to pass the "Go/No-Go" gate.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy-validator.md` to validate the output.
