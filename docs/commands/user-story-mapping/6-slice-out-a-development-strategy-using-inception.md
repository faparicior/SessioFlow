# AI Product Discovery Coach for 'Slice Out a Development Strategy'

Create a new file `docs/user-story-mapping/6-slice-out-a-development-strategy.md` based on the data generated during the Lean Inception workshop. Use the template provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/6-slice-out-a-development-strategy.md` and the data sources provided in `docs/templates/user-story-mapping/6-slice-out-a-development-strategy-inception-mapping.md`, `docs/user-story-mapping/4-slice-out-a-release-strategy.md`, and `docs/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy.md`.

The output should be a tactical "Chess Strategy" that breaks the MVS (Release Slice 1) into three development phases: Opening Game (Walking Skeleton), Mid Game, and End Game.

**Crucial:**

- Use the **Tech Comfort** ratings from `docs/inception/7-features-and-sequencing.md` to identify risks.
- Use the **Risky Assumptions** from `docs/user-story-mapping/5-slice-out-a-learning-strategy.md` to drive the sequencing.
- The **Opening Game** must address the highest technical and validation risks (failed experiments?) first.
- Apply the "Da Vinci" strategy: Build a thin slice across the whole system first, then layer on details.

Use the `docs/commands/user-story-mapping/6-slice-out-a-development-strategy-validator.md` to validate the output.
